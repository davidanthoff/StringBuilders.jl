## Overview

A simple type for building up ``String``s. Use as follows:

````julia
using StringBuilders

sb = StringBuilder()
append!(sb, "First string")
append!(sb, "Second string")

s = String(sb)
````

The advantage of StringBuilders.jl over using `IOBuffer` is in the API. Some may find The higher-level StringBuilders.jl API easier to use. For comparison, the example above using `IOBuffer` would be

```julia
io = IOBuffer()
write(io, "First string")
write(io, "Second String")
s = String(take!(io))
close(io)
```
